# Random Recipe Finder

I've completed the js for **Random Recipe Finder**. And do excuse me for I choose **getRandomRecipe** as the name of main Function instead of **onRandomRecipe**, because i find it more suitable for this specific assignment.

You can find a 10 random recipes by clicking Get Random Recipe Button. It will also describe the steps you need to take to make the recipe shown.

Visit the [link](https://noob-recipe-finder.netlify.app/) and find your recipe!

## Starter Code for Assignment Module 3

### Run the project

- npm install
- npm run dev

  `{
  title: "Spaghetti Carbonara",
  instructions:
    "1. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions. 2. In a separate pan, cook pancetta until crispy. 3. In a bowl, whisk eggs and grated cheese. 4. Combine spaghetti, pancetta, and egg mixture, stirring quickly. 5. Serve immediately with additional cheese and black pepper.",

}`

- Create an on `click` listener for the button
- Create a function `onRandomRecipe` where it will set the HTML DOM for `recipe-title` `recipe-instruction` and `recipe-image`
- The function will also set `recipe-image` width to "200px" and set `#getRecipeBtn` to be disappeared after click.
- Bind the function `onRandomRecipe` to the `click` listener button

### Challenge your limits!

- Make a proper variable name for more a readable code.
- Put things into a variable for a meaningful naming.
- Make a function to get the random recipe for more neat code.
